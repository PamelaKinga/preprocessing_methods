# Data Preprocessing Methods

What is data preprocessing? Formally, data preprocessing is an integral part of any machine learning project. Raw data often contains irrelevant, redundant, noisy, incomplete and unreliable data. This significantly affects the model outcomes and knowledge discovery, making the training phase more difficult. As such, preprocessing is necessary before training the machine learning models; transforming data into suitable formats for a particular machine learning problem, removing outliers, and scaling features to an equivalent range, among other techniques are essential considerations at the beginning of a project. All of this accounts for the lion's share of a successful data science project.

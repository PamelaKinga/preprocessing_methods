# Data Preprocessing Methods

What is data preprocessing? 
- Formally, data preprocessing is an integral part of any machine learning project. 
- Raw data often contains irrelevant, redundant, noisy, incomplete and unreliable data. This significantly affects the model outcomes and knowledge discovery, making the training phase more difficult. 
- As such, preprocessing is necessary before training the machine learning models; transforming data into suitable formats for a particular machine learning problem, removing outliers, and scaling features to an equivalent range, among other techniques are essential considerations at the beginning of a project. 
- All of this accounts for the lion's share of a successful data science project.

In broad strokes, data preprocessing includes:
  1. Data cleaning
  2. Data integreation
  3. Data reduction
  4. Data transformation
